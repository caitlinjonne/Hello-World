# Hello-World
The coding adventure begins...

Novice coder here! I've always been more of a writer, but discovered coding through website design. 
It's like a little puzzle, this coding business. 
I'm almost embarassed to say that I've spent entire evenings trying to crack a particular code to enact a specific change to a design, but the satisfaction of figuring it out is priceless.
